Provides support for Piwik integration via the WP-Piwik plugin in your WooCommerce powered store.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates your WooCommerce store with the [WP-Piwik plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-piwik/) plugin, providing support for tracking your checkout process through Piwik. Please note that you need your own Piwik installation for this plugin (and WP-Piwik) to function, look at the [Piwik website](http://piwik.org/) to get more information.

Starting WooCommerce 2.1, this integration will no longer be part of WooCommerce and will only be available by using this plugin.

Contributions are welcome via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coenjacobs/wc-piwik-integration).

2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installationâ€™s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

Or use the automatic installation wizard through your admin panel, just search for this plugins name.
